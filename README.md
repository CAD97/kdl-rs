# kdl - Kat's Document Language

[kdl](https://github.com/kdoclang/kdl) is a document language, mostly based on [SDLang](https://sdlang.org), with
xml-like semantics that looks like you're invoking a bunch of CLI commands!

It's meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration
language, and is relatively light on syntax compared to XML.

This repository is the official/reference implementation in Rust, and
corresponds to [the kdl crate](https://crates.io/crates/kdl)

## Design and Discussion

kdl is still extremely new, and discussion about the format should happen over
on the [spec repo's discussions
page](https://github.com/kdoclang/kdl/discussions). Feel free to jump in and
give us your 2 cents!

## License

The code in this repository is covered by [the Parity License](LICENSE.md), a
strong copyleft license. That means that you can only use this project if
you're working on an open source-licensed product (MIT/Apache projects are
ok!)
